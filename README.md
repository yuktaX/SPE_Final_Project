## CS 816 Software Production Engineering
## Final Project - Chat Application

Our project focuses on deploying and managing a real-time chat application built with Spring
Boot for backend and ReactJS for frontend. The application enables users to send and receive
messages through a WebSocket-based back-end for real-time communication, paired with a
user-friendly front-end interface. The project integrates key DevOps tools such as Docker for
containerization, Jenkins for automated CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes for scalable deployment,
and Ansible for configuration management. The goal of the project is to emphasize the DevOps
tools and workflows used to develop, deploy, and monitor applications effectively.
